# SortingVisualizer
The sorting visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize different sorting algorithms.

**Abstract**
 1) This project is a sorting visualizer that allows users to see different sorting algorithms in action.
 2) The user can choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
 3) The visualizer also allows users to control the speed of the animations and the size of the data set.
 4) The code for the project is well-organized and uses a separation of concerns, which makes it easy to maintain and modify.
 5) **Some of the key features of the project include:**
    * The ability to see different sorting algorithms in action.
    * The ability to control the speed of the animations.
    * The ability to control the size of the data set.
    *  Well-organized and easy-to-maintain code.

**Implemented algorithms:**
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort

**Colored representation of step being executed:**
  1) **Blue**: Default.
  2) **Yellow**: Being compared.
  3) **Red**: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved.
  4) **Green**: In a correct position.

**3 Controls for visualizations:**
  1) Speed of visualization (6 speed levels)
  2) Data size ()
  3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
